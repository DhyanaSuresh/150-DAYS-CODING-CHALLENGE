# 150-DAYS-CODING-CHALLENGE

ðŸš€ Day 1: Two Sum - Finding the Perfect Pair!
Problem Statement:
You are given an array of integers nums and a target integer target. Your task is to find two numbers in the array that add up to the target. Return their indices as the result. Assume thereâ€™s exactly one solution, and you cannot use the same element twice.

Logic:

1 . Use a hashmap to store each number and its index as you iterate through the array.
2 . For each number, calculate the complement (target - current number).
3 . If the complement exists in the hashmap, return the indices of the current number and its complement.
4 . Otherwise, store the current number in the hashmap for future reference.
5 . This ensures an efficient solution with O(n) time complexity.


ðŸŒŸ Day 2: Add Two Numbers - Summing Up in Style!
Problem Statement:
You are given two non-empty linked lists that represent two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each node contains a single digit. Add the two numbers together and return the sum as a linked list. Assume the numbers do not contain leading zeros.

Logic:

1 . Traverse both linked lists digit by digit. If one list is shorter, treat the missing digits as 0.
2 . Add the digits from both lists along with a carry value (initially 0).
3 . Store the result of (sum % 10) as a new node in the output list (this gives the current digit).
4 . Update the carry to (sum / 10) to handle overflow to the next digit.
5 . Continue until both lists and the carry are fully processed.
6 . The result linked list represents the sum, stored in reverse order.
